There is no root page for this application, rather it relies on Next's dynamic routing capabilities to turn static content (images and paired configuration) and a page template into individualized mapping applications.

Point-to-point distances can be measured by clicking any two locations on the map, each of which places a marker on the map. The second click displaying distance and associated in-game travel times for several means of transit. A third click resets the measurement and removes the markers that were placed with the prior two clicks.
